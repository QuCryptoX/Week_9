We saw for instance that oblivious transfer **is possible** in the noisy storage model. However, what is noise exactly? We will make the notion of noise more precise in this notebook :-).\n",

She sends the bits encoded in the randomly chosen BB84 bases $H^{\\theta_1} \\mid x_1\\rangle \\otimes \\ldots \\otimes H^{\\theta_n} \\mid x_n\\rangle$ to Bob. \n",
    "2. If $y=0$, then Bob measures all of the qubits in the standard basis. If $y = 1$, he measures in the Hadamard basis. He records the resulting outcome string $\\tilde{x} = \\tilde{x}_1,\\ldots,\\tilde{x}_n$. \n",

    "5. Bob computes the set of indices $\\mathcal{I} = \\{j\\mid \\theta_j = y\\}$ where the measured in the same basis than Alice. \n",
    "6. Alice chooses two random extractor functions as specified by random seeds $r_0$ and $r_1$. She computes $k_0 = Ext(x_{+},r_0)$ and $k_1 = Ext(x_{\\times},r_1)$. Where $x_{+}$ is the substring of $x$ where Alice encoded in the standard basis, and $x_{\\times}$ is the substring where she used the Hadamard basis. She sends $r_0$ and $r_1$ to Bob. \n",

    "Let us call $\\rho$ the state that Bob receives from Alice (which might consist of many qubits). In step 2, he places carefully $\\rho$ in a quantum memory. He waits a time $\\Delta t$. If he still had $\\rho$ after waiting $\\Delta t$ he would be able to recover all of Alice's bits, however, since his memory is noisy after this time, the state in the memory will not be $\\rho$ anymore, it will be some noisy version of $\\rho$ that we denote by $N(\\rho)$."
